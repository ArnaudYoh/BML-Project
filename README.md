# Bayesian Machine Learning Project

In this project, we implemented and trained a Neural Network using the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. 

# How to run

In order to visualize some results the user can run the `model.py` file.
Note that the two interesting variables to play with are the [batch numbers](https://github.com/naunauyoh/BML-Project/blob/master/SGLD_NN/model.py#L135) and the [sequence of learning rates](https://github.com/naunauyoh/BML-Project/blob/master/SGLD_NN/model.py#L151). 


The model is based on the code provided by [Javier Antoran](https://github.com/JavierAntoran) at [SGLD](https://github.com/JavierAntoran/Bayesian-Neural-Networks/tree/master/src/Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics)
